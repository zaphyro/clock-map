# clock-map
design a gadget to transport information about the problem to support the astronaut when he/she go to solve a problem in a satelite or in a space station 

In our proyect we have to resolve a problem in the space, we focus in the problem of the comunication out the space station, where the space man doesn't have time to lose receiving every instruction separately as advanced in his mision. This gadget have gates whereby have an access to the information required to solve the problem. 
We  will going to do  this proyect in solidworks,because we use to model the prototip for proyect  in this program

In this proyect we select the proyect "SPACE WEARABLES: DESIGNING FOR TODAY’S LAUNCH & RESEARCH STARS" in which elaborate in SolidWorks a gadget similar a clock,in which the astronaut could have access to a information network to resolve diferents problems.
this gadget will have diferents  Micro SD´s everyone with differents manuals with diagrams about the diferents estructures in the space, like that, maps about the electreic estructures.
